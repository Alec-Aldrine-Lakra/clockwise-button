# Clockwise-Rotating-Buttons
My first remote repository

This code consists of 9 buttons labelled 1-9 arranged as a 3*3 matrix and whenever one clicks on button 5,
the numbers labelled on the buttons move clockwise . For example:

Sample Input

1 2 3

7 8 9

After clicking button 5 in the middle

4 1 2
7 5 3
8 9 6
